  <h2>'Game of Life' Sim</h2>
  <caption>May 2016</caption>
  <p>
    I was introduced to Conway's game of life in my first CS course. The simplicity of it's universe made it very accessible to me even though I had no programming experience and it is one of the first things that got me excited about computer science. Using JavaScript I created my own very simple, but colorful, game of life simulator.

        <span>You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.
        This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card.</span>
