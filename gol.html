  <h2>'Game of Life' Sim</h2>
  <caption>May 2016</caption>
  <p>
    I was introduced to Conway's game of life in my first CS course. The simplicity of it's universe made it very accessible to me even though I had no programming experience and it is one of the first things that got me excited about computer science. Using JavaScript I created my own simple, but colorful, game of life simulator.
